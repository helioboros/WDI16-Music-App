## Process of Creating

This was my original plan for Project 4. However, upon hearing that we needed an external API for the project, I attempted to create a library app.

Quite honestly, I found myself way in over my head, trying to make something that I didn't have the skill to pull off in a week. After spending most of my project time working on that, I fell back on this project.

My original thought was, 'what if there was a website on which you could upload your music', akin to Soundcloud. Due to the cost of hosting mp3 and m4a files on external sites, I decided to use something called react-player, an add-on that lets you paste in youtube and soundcloud links instead.

Due to having work over the weekend, an interview during class, and household responsibilities, time crunch was a major issue, and there are still bugs to be patched out and styling to do.

Given more time, I would want to hunt down and extinguish those bugs, fix the styling, and add an actual authentication process, as well as a favorite songs model.
